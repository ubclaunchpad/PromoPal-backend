### 📝 Creating new issues

🎉 Any issue, whether it be bugs, feature requests, or general feedback is welcome!

Please do a quick search of past issues before opening a ticket. If you are working on a ticket, please assign yourself to it, and unassign yourself if you decide to stop working on it. Make sure your tickets are tagged with the correct labels.

If you would like to make a suggestion, please create an issue with the following information included:
- Description of the 'problem'
- Brief justification of a solution

### ⚠ Bug reporting

Bugs can be reported by any one at any time. Check `bugs` label for duplicate reports.  Bug reports should contain:
- a **description** of the bug (*what* happened)
- detailed **steps** to reproduce the bug (*when* the bug happened)
- a **screen shot** of the bug (if possible)
- browser, OS, version # of Node (this can help us understand *why* the bug occurred)
- any other **notes** (e.g. if the bug only occurs in certain situations)

If you find an existing bug report that is missing information (such as if a bug can be reproduced in other ways), feel free to add details.

## 🌿 Branch naming

Branches should be named to refer to the component of Foodies the changes pertain to, as well as a related ticket. The component should correspond to the Labels that the issue is associated with:

<!--  `TODO: Component/Example-Branch` -->

## 💬 Commit Messages
When writing a commit message, avoid messages like `fix` or`wip` - for example, write `Fix x` or `Scaffold y`.

Small changes and large commits should be squashed, with the exception of large changes where the history of commits may be preserved.


<!-- # Setup

`TODO: Set up (once our code base is more complete)` -->

<!-- # Code style -->
